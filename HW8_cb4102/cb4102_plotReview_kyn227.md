**CONTENT**

**Clarity, Aesthetic and Accuracy of Representation:** 
The plot is trying to convey multiple information in a single plot which may be rather distracting.The placement of the mean and SD of the number of minutes late with number of buses graph can perhaps be shifted to the white space on the right or below in the larger grey area such that it is not placed right beside the CDF curve. At first glance it looked like an annotation for the CDF curve.  

The information is interesting, where focusing on the bar graph i can understand that majority of the buses are late by less than 20 minutes. 

**Suggestions for improvements:**
I would suggest that for plots with two y-axis-es, both y-axis should be constrained to data that has absolute counts to limit the number of information conveyed in a single plot. In this case, one of the y-axis is a cumulative distribution function which is an acccumulation of probabilities. Perhaps the CDF line can be plotted on another graph or omitted.
