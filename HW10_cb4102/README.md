### HW10 Submission:

#### Academic disclaimer: I worked on this assignment alone.

#### Assignment 1: For assignment 1 we were required to finish the inclass lab. The purpose of the lab was to introduce likelihood ratio tests between two models. The LR test is a good tool to use to determine goodness of fit of two models to underlying data. This gives us a objective measure to decide whether introducing more complexity is beneficial.

#### Assignment 2: Assignment 2 built on the lab but used real world data on energy consumption and BBL. We also learned about log scaling data and using this as a tool to improve regression analysis.
